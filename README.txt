This is my solution for the 2025 COS720 Semester Project.

In this zip there are 7 Jupyter Notebooks and 7 corresponding datasets. The Notebooks that begin with my student number are the ones where I trained the datasets.

There are also 3 Python files (.py) which is where ny web based app is built on.
 to run my project you need to have Python, streamlit, pickle, numpy, pandas and sklearn installed.

 Once installed run the following command in the terminal (there isn't a need to train the models again as I have already dumped the trained models as pkl files and is included in the code base.)

 streamlit run Phisherman.py

 you can input your own test emails or use the test emails I provided that are in files test[x].txt where [x] = a number starting from 1 (I am not entirely sure how many text files I will provide, I will return to this).

 Kind Regards
